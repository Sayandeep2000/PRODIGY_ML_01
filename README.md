Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

Project Overview
The notebook is structured as follows:

Introduction

Brief description of the problem statement.
Objective of the project.
Data Loading and Exploration

Importing necessary libraries.
Loading the dataset.
Initial exploration of the data (e.g., displaying the first few rows, checking for missing values).
Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables (if any).
Feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing the relationships between features and the target variable (SalePrice).
Checking the distribution of the target variable.
Model Training

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the linear regression model.
Displaying the model's coefficients.
Model Evaluation

Making predictions on the test set.
Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualizing the actual vs. predicted values.
Visualization

Plotting the distribution of the predicted SalePrice.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed to run the notebook:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
